# CSC690_final_project

App Name: CryptoCurrencyMonitor
Author: Gabriel Vieira Equitz
Reviewer: Carlos Hernandez

Must have features: The application will connect to the internet and will display in seven major currencies the prices of the ten most traded crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). It will use a PickerView view for that. It will also display the currency conversion of six major currencies against the US dollar. 

Nice to have features: The application will show the price change of the crypto-currencies from one day to the next, as well as the exchange rates changes. 

Estimated time for the "Must have features": 8 hours

Estimated time for the "Nice to have features": 2 hours


UI: The application will have a single view with the following elements:

A picker (created with a pickerView) that will display on the left side the symbols for the crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, etc.) and on the right side the standard currencies (US dollar etc.). Below the picker, we will have the price of the  picked crypto-currency and the derived exchange rate, that is, derived from the prices of the crypto-currencies.
