# CSC690_final_project

App Name: CryptoCurrencyMonitor
Author: Gabriel Vieira Equitz
Reviewer: Carlos

Must have features: The application will connect to the internet and will display in seven major currencies the prices of the ten most traded crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). It will use a PickerView view for that. It will also display the currency conversion of six major currencies against the US dollar. 

Nice to have features: The application will show the price change of the crypto-currencies from one day to the next, as well as the exchange rates changes.
